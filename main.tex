\section{\textbf{Project Idea:} }

\quad X ( Business Holder) wants to open a new delivery service on his locality. He thinks it has great potential and is profitable. He has arranged some local drivers who will be carrying goods door to door. Now for marketing, he uses social media for publicity. His business operation is based on phones. He receives orders over the phone. Then send a photo of the order to one of his currently available drivers. The driver, later on, collects items and carries them to the customer’s home. Finally, the customer checks every item and the bill for the order and pays for the service. 

Y (Customer) thinks he can use X’s service. This service will save him time. He really does not want to visit crowded local bazar at this hot and humid weather. But he finds it difficult to connect one of the phone numbers provided by X. Y is hoping X will start taking orders from apps or sites. It would be much better for him. 

 So what we want to provide X is a web platform where his customers will place orders. If they prefer over phones then X will initiate a new order for his service, where he will place an order on behalf of his customers. This service will generate a better invoice which X will send to his employee. At the end of the day, it will be easier for X to keep track of his daily business. Moreover, this can help X’s business to grow better. And X will use this provide as pay peruse. We will be taking care of his all technical issues. 

We can provide this service to any local delivery business around the country.

\section{\textbf{Lessons learned from the project:}}
\begin{itemize}

\item Development resources, used throughout the project, were rather inadequate.
\item Overall project goals and requirements could not be frozen early enough.
\item  Start small, then extend.
\item Add logging and error handling early.
\item Test the parts before the whole.
\item  Everything takes longer than one think.
\item First understand the existing code.
\item  Fix the known errors, then see what’s left.
\item Finally, Keep learning.
\end{itemize}
The result — as the software itself goes — turned out to be according to the goals and expectations. The experience gained in the area of project management is still being distilled.
\newpage
\section{\textbf{Success of the project:}}
As there were clear objectives and requirements for the website,it was easier to get the output as intended.More documentation can increase any software's or project's success rate.To start a project, there must be a plan before executing the project.There could be change in the middle of project but there should always be a plan.To avoid any unwanted output,one should follow the best practices.As the website was built while keeping this details in the head,it can be said that the project was successful.It matches all the expectations from the requirement and performs accordingly as intended.We rate it overall as an outstanding success.
\section{\textbf{Next Steps:}}
Some features can be added in the next development phase.\\
\subsection{Customer Side:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GPS order tracking:The ability to track the current location of package and the time of arrival using location services could be added.
    \item In-app messaging : integration with phone calls is needed to re-schedule the delivery or contact the driver after the order has been accepted.
    \item Rating system: The ability to rate the courier and leave feedback.
    \item Push notifications for cases when the order is on the way or has arrived
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Service Provider Side:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In-app messaging: for communication with the customers.
    \item Delivery status: A delivery man can update the customer when he has accepted/rejected the order, picked it up and delivered.
    \item Ratings and feedback: For complete transparency, not only the customers, but the service providers should also be able to rate their customers and leave feedback about the order.
\end{itemize}
